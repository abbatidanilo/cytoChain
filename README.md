# cytoChain
This is a first prototype of cytoChain a Shiny web app to handle data high-dimensional cytofluorometry datasets. 
It has been deployed by Danilo Abbati and Francesco Manfredi at the Experimental Hematology department of the San Raffaele Hospital - Milan (Italy). 
cytoChain has been published in the European Journal of Immunology (EJI) with the title: "Flow cytometry data mining by cytoChain identifies determinants of exhaustion and stemness in TCR-engineered T cells" (doi will be available soon). 

Load your compensated samples, namely your *.FCS* (standard 3.0) files with the *File Input* control slot in the `Pre-clustering workflow` or in the `Metadata and assays` main side-panel and go throught step by step, all the tabs you need. It is possible to set all the relevant parameters offered in the various side-panels and you may also edit some meta-data related to your samples in the `Metadata and assays` main side-panel. The various analysis are offered within the `Clustering workflow` main side-panel and the related sub-choices.

Manual available. The application will be keep on updating with new features
