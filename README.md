# cytoChain
This first prototype of cytoChain, a Shiny web app to handle high-dimensional cytofluorometry datasets, is currently deployed at the shinyapps.io servers and it is available at the following link:  https://abbatidanilo.shinyapps.io/cytoChain/

In case you are interested in cytoChain for your cytometric analisys drop a mail with a description of your goals, expriments and aims to abbati.danilo@hsr.it. 
I will provide you the credentials for a complete access.

It has been deployed by Danilo Abbati and Francesco Manfredi at the Experimental Hematology department of the San Raffaele Hospital - Milan (Italy). 
cytoChain has been published in the European Journal of Immunology (EJI) with the title: "Flow cytometry data mining by cytoChain identifies determinants of exhaustion and stemness in TCR-engineered T cells" (doi: 10.1002/eji.202049103). 

Load your compensated samples, namely your *.FCS* (standard 3.0) files with the *File Input* control slot in the `Pre-clustering workflow` or in the `Metadata and assays` main side-panel and go throught step by step, all the tabs you need. It is possible to set all the relevant parameters offered in the various side-panels and you may also edit some meta-data related to your samples in the `Metadata and assays` main side-panel. The various analysis are offered within the `Clustering workflow` main side-panel and the related sub-choices.

Manual available. The application will be keep on updating with new features
